Variable:

Variable Rules:

    * Variable 3 Major Rules ( If we break one of these rules, it will not be a variable ):
        1. Variable should be start with var sign.                  Example: var name;
        2. Variable name only can use a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, $           Example: name, age, class3, first_name, lastName etc.
        3. No number at first.                                      Example: ( var 9class ) It will not be a variable.

    * Variable 3 Standard Rules ( If we break these rules, the variable will work. but it will not follow the standard ):

        1. Variable name will always be small letter.               Example: ( var NAME ) This will be a variable but still it didn't follow standard. we could make it like: var name.
        2. Variable name should be meaning full.                    Example: var name = 20; This variable didn't follow standard, because name can't be 20, is it was age = 20 then it would be okay.
        3. Variable name should be readable.                        Example: var firstclassname This will be a variable but not readable, if it would first_class_name or firstCLassName then it would follow standard.


For multiple spacing in a sting:
    &nbsp
    Example: document.write("Anowar" + "&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp" + "Hosen");


Javascript Operator:

    * Arithmetic Operator
        * Binary    ( +, -, *, /, % )
        * Unary     ( ++, --, - )
    * Assignment Operator   ( =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= )
    * Conditional Operator  ( >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, ===, !== )
    * Logical Operator      ( &&, ||, ! )


For a statement/instruction we will have 5 things in every programming language:
    1. Syntax
    2. Values
    3. Operators
    4. Expressions ( Expression will have only operator and value. No Syntax, Comments )
    5. Comments
